# Sports Scores Demo using Flutter and MigratoryData w/ or w/o Kafka

This is a multi-platform app written in Dart with Flutter UI &mdash; which can be compiled as a web app, or as an Android or iOS mobile app, or as a desktop app for MacOS, Windows, or Linux. Please refer to the blog post [Building realtime web and mobile apps that scale to millions of users with Flutter and Kafka](https://migratorydata.com/blog/migratorydata-with-flutter-and-kafka/) for more context.

## Prerequisites

We assume you have the Flutter framework installed. Otherwise, get it as detailed [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

## Use the existing MigratoryData deployment

This app is configured to connect to a MigratoryData deployment available at `demo.migratorydata.com`, so you can run it  without installing MigratoryData or Kafka.

However, if you wish to run this demo with your MigratoryData deployment or your MigratoryData & Kafka deployment please 
install MigratoryData or MigratoryData & Kafka as detailed [here](INSTALL.md).
